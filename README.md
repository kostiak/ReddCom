# ReddCom

Reddit-like comment component build using React.js as I'm learning the React eco-system.

## Install

To install the project locally (for developing, testing, etc.), clone it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kostiak/ReddCom.git
```

And install `npm` packages:

```shell
npm install
```

## Build

To get a build of the project, make sure you have `grunt` install

```
npm install -g grunt
```

and run the `build` task:

```
grunt build
```

## Develop

For easiest development, a `dev` task is provided that will rebuild the project when the source files are changed:

```
grunt dev
```
